            	This website was written completely from scratch and used only a few resources to create it. Also, no templates, free website creators, or code from other developers was used to develop this website. Though the process of using original material was time consuming and in some cases frustrating, the knowledge gained from it was immeasurable. The only two programs used for this website were <a href="http://brackets.io/?lang=en">Brackets</a> for coding, and <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html">XAMPP</a> for server side applications like Apache Web Server. They are both free open source software.  <br><br>The Apache Web Server and all its files are ran on an Asus laptop behind a firewall that is port forwarded through the router&#39s local ISP. The web server is relatively easy to maintain and the cost is nothing. The server is shut down for a few hours a month for maintenance, updates, and performance upgrades. This helps to improve server speeds and keep security software up to date. <br><br>The programing languages used in this project are PHP, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and HTML. All the code is original without the help from other developers. From this came many bugs, and when dealing with JavaScript, the issues with browser incompatibilities. <br><br>On the top left corner of this website, there is the <a href="http://code.org/">Code.org</a> logo. The logo is JavaScript interactive and if the user hovers over the letters in the logo, they will transform to different colors. I participated in Code.org&#39s Hour of Coding. I am very passionate about Computer Science being taught in secular schools.  With the support from websites like Code.org, Computer Science can have its own curriculum in public schools.
